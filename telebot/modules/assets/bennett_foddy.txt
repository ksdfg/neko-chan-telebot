Oof, you lost a lot of progress. That's a deep frustration, a real punch in the gut.

When to the sessions of sweet silent thought

I summon up remembrance of things past,

I sigh the lack of many a thing sought,

and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:

— William Shakespeare, Sonnet XXX​​ 
---
Patience is the foundation of eternal peace.

Make anger your enemy.
Harm comes to those who know only victory and do not know defeat.

Find fault with yourself and not with others.
It is in falling short of your own goals that you will surpass those who exceed theirs.

— Tokugawa Ieyasu

She smiled in defeat,

But has trouble enough of its own.

I stand amid the roar of a surf-tormented shore,

And I hold within my hand grains of the golden sand.

How few! yet how they creep through my fingers to the deep,

While I weep- while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp them with a tighter clasp?

O God! can I not save one from the pitiless wave [Can I not save one from the pitiless wave in voice]?

Is all that we see or seem but a dream within a dream?

— Edgar Allen Poe 
---
Can I see another's woe,
And not be in sorrow too?

Can I see another's grief,
And not seek for kind relief?

Pain has an element of blank;
It cannot recollect when it began, or if there were

A day when it was not. It has no future but itself,

Its infinite realms contain its past, enlightened to perceive

New periods of pain.
— Emily Dickinson 
---
Oft expectation fails, and most oft where most it promises; and oft it hits where hope is coldest; and despair most sits.

— William Shakespeare, All's Well that Ends Well

Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its

heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.

And could you keep your heart in wonder at the

daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem

less wondrous than your joy.
— Khalil Gibran

(Music) 'Poor Boy A Long Ways from Home' — Barbecue Bob

This is the Hour of Lead
Remembered, if outlived,

First—Chill—then Stupor—then the letting go.

Happened to you. The pain in knowing what more

tears we have gained. But through all this I feel your pain.

I'm crushing your dreams and dashing your hopes

You're climbing a mountain with a hammer and no ropes. 
---
The mountain seems no more a soulless thing,

But rather as a shape of ancient fear,

In darkness and the winds of Chaos born

Amid the lordless heavens' thundering—

A Presence crouched, enormous and austere,

Before whose feet the mighty waters mourn.

— George Sterling 
---
(Music) 'Going Down the Road Feeling Bad' — Ruth Huber and Lois Judd

Knuckles whitening, stomach tightening, once bitten, so many times burned.

(Music) 'When I Grow Too Old To Dream' — Dick Haymes

You're back here again, showing patience and then attacking, scraping then flapping and snagging. 
---
There's no feeling more intense than starting over.

If you've deleted your homework the day before it was due, as I have,

Or if you left your wallet at home and you have to go back, after spending an hour in the commute,

If you won some money at the casino and then put all your winnings on red, and it came up black,

If you got your best shirt dry-cleaned before a wedding and then immediately dropped food on it,

If you won an argument with a friend and then later discovered that they just returned to their original view,

Starting over is harder than starting up.

If you're not ready for that, like if you've already had a bad day

then what you're about to go through might be too much.

Feel free to go away and come back. I'll be here.
